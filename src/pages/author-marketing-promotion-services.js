              In general, the purpose of the author is to entertain the readers with the story, inform them of reality, and persuade them of the truth. But with digital marketing on the rise, this purpose has an additional aspect—to market themselves for readership. The author's skill is reflected in the narrative and style they write in, but their readership is built when they are marketed well. With Book Writing Cube's author promotion services, we create captivation ads for authors. Whether they are Facebook ads for authors or Amazon ads for authors, we deliver!
