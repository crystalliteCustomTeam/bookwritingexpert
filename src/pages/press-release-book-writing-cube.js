                            <p className='font15 fw500 font-f'> <strong>Beaverton, Oregon, March 28, 23</strong>  â€“ Book Writing Cube, a leading provider of book writing and
                                publishing services, would like to take this opportunity to clarify a matter of domain
                                ownership. It has come to our attention that there has been confusion regarding the ownership of
                                a specific domain name. We would like to take this moment to confirm that this domain, <Link className='textdocationnone' href="/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.thebookwritingcube.com/</Link> , is not
                                owned, operated, or affiliated with Book Writing Cube. The correct domain is <Link className='textdocationnone' href="/">https://www.bookwritingcube.com/</Link>.
                            </p>

                            <p className='font15 fw500 font-f'>
                                Book Writing Cube, with years of experience and a commitment to excellence, have established
                                a reputation as a trusted and reliable source for writing and publication services. Our goal is
                                to provide our clients with the best possible experience and deliver results exceeding their

                                of domain ownership. This is why we have taken the time to issue this official statement. It is
                                imperative that our clients and the public at large are aware of the correct information
